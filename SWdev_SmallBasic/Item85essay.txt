FINAL ESSAY:
 An essay explaining how the program I wrote in Exercise 5 contained the five elements of a program.


1. Entrance (aka, First Instruction)
  The “entrance” in the program was to name the window, and establish the program (/language) as a GUI (GraphicsWindow).

2. Control/branching (aka, If/Then)
  The initial branching was which button the user clicked.  
  If the user clicked the button (to attempt) the action - the second branching determined whether or not the user action was within the pre-determined allowance.

3. Variables (Tracking/managing changing values)   This was the part of the program which determined what the current time of the request was, and if that time was within the allowable action period.

4. Sub program (Program within a program)
  One sub program was the part of the program which created and copied the file (and inserted a time stamp to allow all parties to see the last change).  Other subs were the screens shown, and what each button did.

5. Exit 
  The program ended when the user was done and pressed the “Quit” button - available on every screen shown.  There were two outcomes based on the London conditional (if the office was open or not)
