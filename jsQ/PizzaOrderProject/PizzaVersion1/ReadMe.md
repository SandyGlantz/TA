Pizza Ordering Project

Had a lot of fun with this!  See screen shots below.

Requirement was to develop a working html-css-js order form which included an (itemized) receipt (on screen) and total. We were free to add any creative, as long as the ordering prerequisites were met.

Accidentally discovered how many pictures there are of cats and pizza ... even a Japanese commercial campaign for Pizza Hut where the staff is all cats!
On that note: the images are pulled from the Internet and I'm sure some (cough ... ahem ... Pizza Hut) might not be inclined to allow me to use them - even with attribution.  The images are JUST FOR FUN and for personal use.  I do know a real client project would require attribution and permissions (and probably it's own photo shoot).

What I learned:

I learned a lot in this project - more was learned and *not* used than what ended up being used.
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Slideshows (and how my personally made one was inadequate compared to those offered by JSSOR; at least I knew enough to be able to tweak and get what I wanted out of it ;-/ 
- Tons of CSS - including how you CAN change the look of radio and checkboxes - dozens of ways ... (on the future version to-do list, see below).
- Fieldsets, forms, and their alignment and their cross-browser incompatibilities (sigh ...)
- Normalize ... what a great resource!
- Adding sounds
- Changing the cursor! (LOL)
- Cards; and how to get them to play with other elements ... ;-)
- Radio buttons and check boxes formatting, styling, and overriding defaults
- And oh yeah ... a lot of javascript and jQuery!


This is version 1. (!!)
There's a lot on the future version list; as this is a code camp project there wasn't enough time to do everything I wanted (is there ever?).

- !!! Fix fonts not loading on GitHub (pretty sure it's Calbria causing the problem)

- Fix logo: left cat missing right ear; grey between arm and pizza box not selected out; green vertical line between Designed by Cats and Made by Cats; put TM on name; decided whether to keep name as is - or come up with something more clever;

- Make a logo that loads for small screens ... just checked out the page on my iPhone and it looks OK except for the logo.

- Clean up the code.  Because this is still a work in progress there's a lot more than there should be in commenting and commented out code - plus the (code) organization needs a lot of work.

- Add customer form - name, email, etc. - with alert if left empty.  Wasn't required but common sense says it would be on an order form ...

- include customer info in receipt

- !! get clear/reset button to work !!  (and add hissing sfx when it's clicked LOL)

- Change pizza size names on the receipt

- Pick ONE hover cursor style (pizza slice and cat paw are the current finalists)

- Depending on feedback - consider changing meow on order click to a softer meow

- Test JS in strict mode

- Add modal or alert for Kitty Coma Syndrome; onclick event for Party size (the asterisk without anything going to it size ...)

- Clean up CSS - too many redundant lines and too many bad naming conventions

- Go through and verify any needs to add web-kit, moz- and ms styling

- Attractive buttons and checkboxes:
Had a great one going - but it didn't work within the receipt process. Need to come back to that ...

- Get text next to radio and checkboxes to wrap under itself not under the radio/checkbox

- Make quotes (reviews) as images so they can stack or float (i.e., look better)

- Improve staff bios: http://en.rocketnews24.com/2014/08/24/pizza-hut-in-japan-is-now-run-by-four-bossy-felines-in-new-adorable-campaign/

- Change Logo image to have a GREEN vertical bar instead of red (between designed by cats and made by cats)

- A most recent version to personal site under portfolio - make as a second site page with new window open on link click.

- Lots of cosmetics ...


- js slider: should be able to get some of the script out of the html and into the script.js file?
when I tried it broke.  Need to figure out why, and what I can do about it.

- insert GTM (and maybe a GA tag too) ... not sure it will work on the GitHub pagepreview link system - may need to add as a second page to my personal site.
